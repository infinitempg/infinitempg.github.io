Offensively he is a great and innovative thinker. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Austin Copperheads</b><br />I may be biased here, but I think the Copperheads are obviously the better team. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, I am certain that the Copperheads is going to rely on Colt Mendoza - CB on their defense. Big names make big plays in big games, I cannot wait to watch this. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Austin Copperheads</b><br />Look for them to continue their winstreak. <br /></h3><h2>Copperheads racking up yards!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>The offense of the Copperheads is throwing up some serious yardage on everybody this year, posting 6016 total yards and 452 points thus far in 15 games. Quarterback Easton Cole (C) - QB and receiver Eddie Jeeta - WR have hooked up to the tune of 1522 yards this season, while Running Back Zoe Watts (R) - RB has plowed his way  for 1381. The big men on the line has steamrolled opponents for 506 pancakes this season while giving up only 19 quarterback sacks.</h3><h2>'I am better than Silverbacks' Jackson Kingston', says Doug Howlett (R)</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>'We see a lot of players thinking they are the best at their position', said the Hawks WR Doug Howlett (R). He continued. 'I prefer to look at individual players, and ask myself: Am I better than him?'. Doug Howlett (R) brings up Jackson Kingston every chance he gets, it seems. 'Is he faster than me? nah. Look at the tape, once the pads come on he slows down. Sure, he is good and he may even be as good as me some day.' The Hawks WR said. Certainly such words will set the internet forums on fire, and it will be interesting to see if Jackson Kingston takes the bait and responds.</h3><h2>Week 17: RB Marcella Toriki (NOLA) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>The honor comes after Toriki's 20 att, 166 yds, 1 TD performance against the Baltimore Hawks.

They will need to rely on people such as Luke Skywalker (C) - QB and Buck Thornton - SS who are great at coordinating and making sure everyone is doing the right thing on the field. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Austin Copperheads</b><br />The difference in this game will be their offense. They are 5th in the league pass completion percentage. They are 3rd in the league passing touchdowns with 31. They are 2nd in the league passing yards per game. They average 293.1! They are 3rd in the league average yards per rush. They are 1st in the league rushing touchdowns with 21. They are 1st in the league points scored per game. They average 30.4! Can't lose. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />This is a very good defense. They are 5th in sacks with 41. They are 3rd in points allowed, averaging only 23.2. They are 4th in run defense. Giving up only 92.9 yards per game. They are 2nd in interceptions with 18. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Austin Copperheads</b><br />Do not throw statistics at me! The Copperheads win because they are the better team. You heard it here first. <br /></h3><h2>Week 16: RB Julio Tirtawidjaja (CHI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>Week 16's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Julio Tirtawidjaja.

The offense will have to gameplan for him if they want to stand even the slightest chance. A close win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />Do not believe it if anyone tells you the Otters are overhyped. They are who we thought they were. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />I do not think their offense gets enough credit. They are 4th in the league passing touchdowns with 27. They are 5th in the league passing yards per game. They average 275.4! They are maulers, 1st in the league in pancakes. They are 5th in the league rushing touchdowns with 16. They are 5th in the league points scored per game. They average 28.5! This will really be a statement win. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />Believe me. <br /></h3><h2>Week 15: RB Mai Fukushu (BAL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>The honor comes after Fukushu's 17 att, 112 yds, 2 TD, 1 rec, 3 yds, 1 TD performance against the Arizona Outlaws.

Outlaws blames coaching.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Heath Evans seemed almost depressed in an interview after the Outlaws lost to the Gabriel Means. He indicated that a big factor in the loss was the Outlaws' coaching, that appeared one step behind at every turn. 'Surely, we lost, but we were playing well. I think this is a testament to our character and preparation' said the Heath Evans - TE Outlaws. He added: 'The Gabriel Means are a good team, but I we played our hearts out and kept grinding. We learned a lot from this game, and it will help us in the future'.</h3><h2>Week 15: DE Dexter Jackson (R) (SAR) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>DE Dexter Jackson (R) of the Sarasota Sailfish has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

They are 1st in the league pass completion percentage. They are 3rd in the league rushing touchdowns with 15. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />The leadership on this team is great. Having a guy like Davriel Lavigne (R) - FS on the field and in the locker room is exactly what you need to win games like this. A double digit win. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />It is never a single player who wins. It is the TEAM that wins. Playing  as a team is what you need to do to win tough games like this.
