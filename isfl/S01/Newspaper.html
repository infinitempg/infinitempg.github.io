The young T is going to cause headaches for any defense. This week is no difference. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />In this game, you would be a fool not to think Lord Beerus - CB will be a key figure in this game. Do not sleep on this guy's ability. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />Head coach Jamie Eagle has this team running like a well oiled machine. Offensively he is a great and innovative thinker. If they do not win, I have to buy cake for the entire office. That is how sure I am. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Orange County Otters</b><br />I see them winning again this week. <br /></h3><h2>Zoe Watts (R) - RB is looking good!</h2><h3>Zoe Watts (R) - RB is looking amazing out there so far this season. If he keeps playing such impressive football, he’s got a shot at being remembered as one of the greats.</h3><h2>Week 17: RB Marcella Toriki (NOLA) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>The honor comes after Toriki's 22 att, 179 yds, 4 TD performance against the Baltimore Hawks.

He is doing great things in Sarasota. He is one of the best defensive minds. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />The leadership on this team is great. Having a guy like Rapid Eagle - DT on the field and in the locker room is exactly what you need to win games like this. They greatly outscore them here. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />Looking at the teams, I think a good bet is that Lord Beerus - CB is a guy who will carry the game. I think he will do so this week as well. I am looking forward to watching this showdown. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Orange County Otters</b><br />Looking at the teams, I agree with the popular opinion that Suleiman Ramza (R) - QB needs to show up, but if he does the Otters will be putting up points. Can't lose. <br /></h3><h2>Heath Evans consoles Outlaws after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Encouraging words after the Outlaws - Wraiths game. 'Surely, we lost, but we were playing well. I think this is a testament to our character and preparation' said Evans. He added: 'The Wraiths are a good team, but I we played our hearts out and kept grinding. We learned a lot from this game, and it will help us in the future'.</h3><h2>Week 16: QB Sam Howitzer (R) (C) (NYS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/14.png'>The league announced New York Silverbacks quarterback Sam Howitzer (R) (C) has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Silverbacks defeated the Chicago Butchers, 30 to 21.

They will continue that streak. They will win this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />This offense is likely to step up this week. They are 1st in the league passing touchdowns with 31. They are maulers, 1st in the league in pancakes. They are 1st in the league in passes of more than 20 yards. They are 1st in the league points scored per game. They average 28.9! The way they win this game will tell a lot about what they are as a team. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />They play great together. Having a guy like Jamar Lackson - RB on the field who understands what everyone needs to do and helping them play as a unit will help them a great deal in this game. <br /></h3><h2>Top receiver trio?</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>The Yeti trio of William Lim - WR, Leeroy Jenkins - WR and Earl Sauce - TE are currently the leading trio of catchers in the league, with 3076 receiving yards between the three.</h3><h2>Week 15: LB Haha Mango-Panda (SAR) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>LB Mango-Panda absolutely dominated in the Sailfish 55-25 game with the Chicago Butchers.

They are 2nd in points allowed, averaging only 22.2. They are 4th in the league pass average yards per rush. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />I just really like the way they coach in Philadelphia. Head coach Timothy Thomas is doing great things. Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />The Second Line win. You can quote me on that. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />You got to like this offense. They are 1st in the league in sacks allowed. They are 3rd in the league average yards per rush. They are 3rd in the league rushing touchdowns with 17. They are 1st in the league rushing yards per game. They average 134.4! They are 3rd in the league points scored per game. They average 28.3! <br /></h3><h2>Defense dominates in Colorado.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>The Yeti defensive line is ransacking their enemies so far this season with a total of 31 sacks, 8 forced fumbles and 119 tackles in 13 games.</h3><h2>Sparks fly after Butchers-Wraiths game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>Benson Bayley Jr. did not hold back when asked about the Butchers after their game. Benson Bayley Jr. - T known for brutal honesty, said after Chicago beat Yellowknife that the Wraiths's did not seem prepared at all, and that he was frankly embarrased on their behalf. Them be fighting words to many a Wraiths fan, let alone the players. It will be interesting to see if anyone lashes back, or if calmer heads prevail.</h3><h2>Week 14: QB Wolfie McDummy (C) (COL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>The Colorado Yeti' Wolfie McDummy (C) threw 5 touchdowns, completing 24 of 31 passes for 417 yards in the Yeti victory over the Baltimore Hawks.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 10 for McDummy (C), has seen some impressive numbers including 24 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 14: CB Brandon Booker (C) (PHI) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>CB Brandon Booker (C) of the Philadelphia Liberty has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

I just have this hunch. Just win baby. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Chicago Butchers</b><br />Head coach Pete Carder runs a tight ship in Chicago. I feel certain he has prepared an excellent gameplan. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Chicago Butchers</b><br />In the context of this game, it seems obvious that Butchers got to love fielding Osiris Firestorm-Fjord - CB on their defense. This man will be critical this week, and will give the offense plenty of trouble. But it will be a close game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Chicago Butchers</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, I cannot see how anyone would not think that Sean O'Leary (C) - WR needs to show up, but if he does the Butchers will be putting up points. Just win baby. <br /></h3><h2>Optimism after Sailfish-Second Line game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>LiterallyJust A.

I am sure head coach Emery Gallant has them prepared for this game. He is doing some really smart things on offense. He is has a really good understanding of what works on defense. The referees will have their work cut out for them. This will be very competitive and intense. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />You just have to look at their defense. They are 1st in points allowed, averaging only 17.4. They are 2nd in pass defense. They only give up 220 per game. They are 5th in run defense. Giving up only 88.3 yards per game. They are 1st in interceptions with 15. They are 1st in the league in tackles for loss. They are 4th in forced fumbles. A double digit win. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />Deshun Jones (C) - LB, Garfield Despacito Jr. - WR and Alain Johns - G with their beautiful team play make the difference in this game.

I am sure head coach Herb Mast has them prepared for this game. He is has a really good understanding of what works offensively. This will really be a statement win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Chicago Butchers</b><br />I think their defense is really good. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />For this game, the scouts tell me that Eddie Jeeta - WR will dominate the defense. This is going to be great to watch. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Chicago Butchers</b><br />This week, the Butchers will will need to come together as a team to win. Players like Perry Tucker Jr. - T and Juan Domine (R) - LB who have great team playing skills and understand what everyone needs to to will be pivotal for this. <br /></h3><h2>Ben Stackinpaper blasts the Hawks in aftermath of Hawks loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>Ben Stackinpaper had harsh words for Hawks in a post game interview.
