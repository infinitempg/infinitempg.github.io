'We have to step up, all of us' he said, and continued: 'But they, the coaches, have to get us ready and have the right gameplan. Well, we were not ready and we had the wrong gameplan'. 'I think this roster has great promise, but certain factors are holding us back. One factor might be Emery Gallant. He has not gotten players to buy in, but I hope we can get in sync soon, but something has to give eventually.' the 21 year old T said.</h3><h2>Week 18: SS Bob Bob (OCO) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>SS Bob Bob of the Orange County Otters has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

The way they win this game will tell a lot about what they are as a team. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Chicago Butchers</b><br />They will rely on their offense to pull them through. They are maulers, 4th in the league in pancakes. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />I do not know why. I just have this hunch. They get their win and this game will be just another day at the office. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />For this match up, I cannot help but think that we cannot avoid mentioning Jim Waters - CB. He has been tearing it up so far this season. He will continue to do so today. <br /></h3><h2>Honolulu Hahalua defense dominates!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>The Hahalua' defense is stonewalling opponents this season. In 15 games they’ve surrendered only 4954 total yards and 298 points. Heinrich Kackpoo - LB is the skipper of the defense with 104 stops on the year. Could the D be back in Honolulu?</h3><h2>Tre'Darius J'Vathon (R) consoles Sailfish after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Tre'Darius J'Vathon (R) was not pessimistic in an interview after the Sailfish lost to the Second Line. 'I think we played well and showed some things. The Second Line are a good team and we played them well. There is plenty of promise on this roster, and we will be back and get them next time. Until then it is all about working hard to get there.' the 22 year old WR said.</h3><h2>Week 17: LB Adelie de Pengu (COL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>LB Adelie de Pengu of the Colorado Yeti has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. de Pengu finished with 10 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Week 17: QB Wolfie McDummy (C) (COL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>The league announced Colorado Yeti quarterback Wolfie McDummy (C) has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Yeti defeated the Arizona Outlaws, 49 to 23. McDummy (C) did his part, throwing 6 touchdowns, completing 26 of 34 passes for 335 yards. His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 44 to 6, and a passer rating of 112.0.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 17</h2><h3>Yeti - 49, Outlaws - 23<br />      Wraiths - 23, SaberCats - 16<br />      Hahalua - 35, Copperheads - 16<br />      Fire Salamanders - 27, Butchers - 23<br />      Second Line - 48, Hawks - 13<br />      Silverbacks - 23, Liberty - 14<br />      Otters - 35, Sailfish - 14</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Austin Copperheads at Honolulu Hahalua</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Austin Copperheads</b><br />People tend to underestimate their defense. They are 5th in forced fumbles. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Austin Copperheads</b><br />All aboard the Copperheads hypetrain. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />They will keep their winstreak going. If they lose this one, I will never hear the end of it. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Austin Copperheads</b><br />For this match up, my perspective is that Zoe Watts (R) - RB is the kind of player you just cannot contain for a whole game. <br /></h3><h2>No Pass Zone in Honolulu.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>Hahalua pass defense this year has been dynamite this season, giving up only 3196 in 14 games. Good luck to anybody facing these animals..</h3><h2>Defense dominates in Colorado.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>The Yeti D-Line is gashing their enemies so far this season with a total of 24 sacks, 6 forced fumbles and 151 tackles in 15 games.</h3><h2>Week 16: FS Maverick Bowie (R) (AUS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>FS Maverick Bowie (R) of the Austin Copperheads has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Bowie (R) finished with 3 Tck, 1 Sck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Week 16: RB Zoe Watts (R) (AUS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>The honor comes after Watts (R)'s 27 att, 156 yds, 2 TD, 3 rec, 51 yds, 1 TD performance against the Berlin Fire Salamanders. Watts (R) from Stanford was selected in round 0, 2 years ago.<br /><br />    Watts (R) now has 1170 Rushing Yards and 10 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Criticism of Offensive Coordinator Brian Jenkins after Butchers-Silverbacks game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/14.png'>Harsh words after the Silverbacks - Brian Jenkins game from Sam Howitzer (R) (C). The Silverbacks Brian Jenkins pointed the fingers at the coaching staff, suggesting lackluster preparation was to blame for the loss. The Silverbacks QB said he felt they were outcoached in their latest game. 'We seem to always come up short in the critical situations. I feel like the players are giving their all, but that our coaches just are not holding up their end of the bargain. Especially Offensive Coordinator Brian Jenkins has been a dissapointment, he is just not rising to the moment.', he said.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 16</h2><h3>Wraiths - 30, Hawks - 27<br />      Yeti - 53, Liberty - 20<br />      Otters - 35, SaberCats - 27<br />      Butchers - 17, Silverbacks - 13<br />      Copperheads - 41, Fire Salamanders - 30<br />      Hahalua - 30, Second Line - 10<br />      Sailfish - 31, Outlaws - 24</h3><h2>Game of the Week: New Orleans Second Line at Honolulu Hahalua</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />Look at the team play on the Hahalua. Look at guys like Luke Skywalker (C) - QB, Buck Thornton - SS and Davriel Lavigne (R) - FS then you understand why they win this week. You heard it here first. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />You just have to look at their defense. They are 5th in points allowed, averaging only 24.8. They are 5th in pass defense. They only give up 249.1 per game. They are 1st in interceptions with 19. They are 3rd in the league pass average yards per rush. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />When you consider the two rosters, common sense predicts that Ray-Ray Jackson - CB will run circles around the offense. This is going to be great to watch. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />I just really like the way they coach in Honolulu. Head coach Albert Walling is doing great things. He is innovative with his defense. Believe me. <br /></h3><h2>Who is the better DE? Butchers' Arik Eller (R) weighs in</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>'We see a lot of players thinking they are the best at their position', said the Butchers DE Arik Eller (R). He continued. 'I prefer to look at individual players, and ask myself: Am I better than him?'. The Butchers player remarks came in response to some online speculation about who was the better DE. 'I think I have proved what I am. I feel confident about where I am, but I think maybe Troen Egghands has a little more he needs to prove, if you get me? At least if he want to be compared to me.', he said.</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Raphtalia Chan (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Week 15's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Raphtalia Chan. His 23 att, 175 yds, 1 TD performance stood out in the 42 to 20 victory for the Sarasota Sailfish.<br /><br />    The former UCF gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 1481 Yards and 9 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Eller (R) blasts Cornell Ahstreet - G in wake of Butchers loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>Harsh words after the Butchers - Sailfish game from Arik Eller (R). The Butchers DE called out the Butchers' players, suggesting some of his teammates were phoning it in. 'We lost and somebody is to blame. If you look at the game, you will see some players just are not delivering.' said the Butchers DE. Asked to clarify, Eller (R) suggested Cornell Ahstreet - G needs to perform better, but underscored that there was plenty of blame to go around. 'Guys need to listen, we need to get grinding, you cannot just show up and expect to play or expect to win', Eller (R) concluded.</h3><h2>Week 15: CB Jim Waters (HON) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>CB Waters's ball hawking ability was on display in the Hahalua 35-24 game with the Orange County Otters. He finished with 2 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD.<br /><br />    "Jim has the unique ability to make plays and generate turnovers." -Hahalua Defensive Coordinator</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 15</h2><h3>Hawks - 48, Outlaws - 31<br />      Yeti - 28, SaberCats - 23<br />      Sailfish - 42, Butchers - 20<br />      Fire Salamanders - 36, Silverbacks - 10<br />      Hahalua - 35, Otters - 24<br />      Wraiths - 19, Copperheads - 15<br />      Liberty - 37, Second Line - 23</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Arizona Outlaws at Baltimore Hawks</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />This is just what my gut tells me. There will be a lot to dissect after this game. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />You just have to look at their defense. They are 2nd in sacks with 38. They are 2nd in points allowed, averaging only 21.3. They are 1st in run defense. Giving up only 71.1 yards per game. They are 2nd in the league in tackles for loss. They are 3rd in forced fumbles. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />Doug Howlett (R) - WR. Nacho Fries - G. IHeart Syracuse - FS. Team players! With guys who can gell like that, they get wins. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />I find it hard to bet against coach Isidro Combs. He always has them well prepared. He is one of the best defensive minds. A tough choice. I think it will be a close game. <br /></h3><h2>No Pass Zone in Honolulu.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>Hahalua pass defense this year has been lights-out this season, giving up only 2742 in 12 games. With this performance they have struck fear into QBs around the league..</h3><h2>Week 14: QB Chika Fujiwara (C) (BAL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>The Baltimore Hawks' Chika Fujiwara (C) threw 3 touchdowns, completing 41 of 52 passes for 435 yards in the Yeti victory over the Baltimore Hawks.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 5 for Fujiwara (C), has seen some impressive numbers including 17 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Sparks fly after Second Line-Hawks game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>Busch Light (R) came out swinging in an interview after the Second Line beat the Hawks. 'That was a pretty poor showing on their part' said the Busch Light (R) - LB Second Line. Continuing with details about the Hawks's players missed tackles and lack of communication Light (R) did not hold back. He will surely have put off several Hawks fans, as well as people in his own front office.</h3><h2>Week 14: DE Sandro Ryeu (ARI) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>DE Sandro Ryeu of the Arizona Outlaws has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Ryeu finished with 6 Tck, 2 Sck, 1 FF, 1 FR.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 14</h2><h3>Yeti - 27, Hawks - 27<br />      Outlaws - 24, Liberty - 16<br />      Second Line - 45, Butchers - 24<br />      Hahalua - 41, Sailfish - 31<br />      Silverbacks - 28, Copperheads - 19<br />      SaberCats - 31, Fire Salamanders - 27</h3><h2>Chicago Butchers resigns Robert Edwards as Offensive Coordinator</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>The Butchers have announced that they have given Robert Edwards a new contract. Edwards will continue to serve as Offensive Coordinator for 3 years earning 5.8 million pr year.</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Chicago Butchers at New Orleans Second Line</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Chicago Butchers</b><br />Looking at the teams, most people agree that George O'Donnell - QB drives defenses crazy. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />They will win again this week. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Chicago Butchers</b><br />One of the most underestimated defenses.

I see a lot of points being scored in this game. <br /></h3><h2>Week 3: LB Tyron Brackenridge (C) (SJS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>LB Tyron Brackenridge (C) of the San Jose SaberCats has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

The Wraiths T said he saw good things from his team in the game against the Hawks. 'We proved this game that we have it in us. We came close and we showed what we are all about.

Boy, oh boy am I looking forward to this. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />For this game, a good bet is that the Hahalua' defense goes through Ray-Ray Jackson - CB. When he is at his best, the Hahalua offense is like a well oiled machine. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />They are well coached. I am sure head coach Albert Walling has them prepared for this game. He is has a really good understanding of what works on defense. <br /></h3><h2>Week 2: CB Dukburg QuakStak (R) (NYS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/14.png'>CB QuakStak (R)'s ball hawking ability was on display in the Silverbacks 55-34 game with the Sarasota Sailfish.

He is doing great things in Honolulu. Defensively he makes great adjustments. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />For this match up, I think that Ray-Ray Jackson - CB has to potential to carry the Hahalua defense. It may even be a blow out. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, I think a good bet is that Asher Montain - DE has to potential to carry the Hahalua defense. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Berlin Fire Salamanders</b><br />This week, the Fire Salamanders will will need to come together as a team to win. Players like Asher Quinn - CB and Benoit Blanco - SS who have great team playing skills and understand what everyone needs to to will be pivotal for this. I see a lot of points being scored in this game. <br /></h3><h2>SaberCats lost.
