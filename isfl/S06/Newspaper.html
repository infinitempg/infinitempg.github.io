Zee Rechs (R) - TE was clearly upset in the Wraiths loss. 'We learned a lot. We learned a lot about our coaches. We realized that there is a reason we are losing. I am not sure what Matthew Jones saw in his preparation, but he has to do a better job at Offensive Coordinator', the TE said.</h3><h2>Week 18: RB Raphtalia Chan (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Week 18's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Raphtalia Chan.

You only need to look at guys like Zamir Kehla - CB and Pete Miller - DT to see the importance. Leadership like that helps you win games. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />In this game, I see no way in which you can discount that Jamar Lackson - RB is the guy to watch, this man is pivotal to the SaberCats offense. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />I really think their offense will make the difference. They are 5th in the league in sacks allowed. They are maulers, 3rd in the league in pancakes. They are 5th in the league average yards per rush. They are 5th in the league rushing touchdowns with 18. They are 5th in the league rushing yards per game. They average 116.3! <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Look for them to continue their winstreak. <br /></h3><h2>SaberCats' Rando Cardrissian has an opinion on who is the best RB</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>RB Rando Cardrissian had words of praise for himself in a recent interview. 'I am one of the best RBs in the game', he said. Rando Cardrissian brings up Joseph Petrongolo every chance he gets, it seems. 'Is he faster than me? nah. Look at the tape, once the pads come on he slows down. Sure, he is good and he may even be as good as me some day.' The SaberCats RB said. Certainly such words will set the internet forums on fire, and it will be interesting to see if Joseph Petrongolo takes the bait and responds.</h3><h2>Week 17: CB David Rector (NOLA) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>CB Rector's ball hawking ability was on display in the Second Line 59-27 game with the Baltimore Hawks. He finished with 7 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD.<br /><br />    "David has the unique ability to make plays and generate turnovers." -Second Line Defensive Coordinator</h3><h2>Week 17: RB Julio Tirtawidjaja (CHI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>The honor comes after Tirtawidjaja's 25 att, 138 yds, 1 TD, 3 rec, 102 yds, 1 TD performance against the Berlin Fire Salamanders. Tirtawidjaja from Nebraska was selected in round 0, 4 years ago.<br /><br />    Tirtawidjaja now has 1339 Rushing Yards and 10 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 17</h2><h3>Outlaws - 17, Yeti - 5<br />      SaberCats - 22, Wraiths - 21<br />      Hahalua - 30, Copperheads - 14<br />      Butchers - 30, Fire Salamanders - 16<br />      Second Line - 59, Hawks - 27<br />      Silverbacks - 27, Liberty - 13<br />      Otters - 30, Sailfish - 27</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Austin Copperheads at Honolulu Hahalua</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Austin Copperheads</b><br />They will increase their winstreak to two this week. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />With people like Luke Skywalker (C) - QB and Buck Thornton - SS who understand the value of team play it is easy to see why the Hahalua win this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />Looking at the teams, the received view holds that Dermot Lavelle Jr. - CB will run circles around the offense. This is going to be great to watch. This should be some good football. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />I may be biased here, but I think the Hahalua are obviously the better team. A single digit win. <br /></h3><h2>Week 16: WR William Lim (COL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>Lim's 6 rec, 170 yds, 2 TD effort led the way for the Colorado Yeti. This weeks 170 receiving yards bring his season total to 1348 yards with 10 touchdowns on the season.<br /><br />    "To William, football is about winning and nothing else. He is one of the hardest workers on our team and deserves the attention he is getting from the media and fans." - Yeti Coach</h3><h2>Jeffrey Phillips lashes out in wake of loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Jeffrey Phillips was angry with his teammates after the loss. He said that the entire team needed to step up. However, he also singled out some teammates. 'Man, I think a bunch of guys let us down. I could point the finger at many.' the 18 year old FB said. Later in the interview he seemed to indicate that Alain Johns - G was one of the players he had in mind.</h3><h2>Week 16: DE Asher Montain (HON) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>DE Montain absolutely dominated in the Hahalua 34-17 game with the New Orleans Second Line. He finished with 7 Tck, 2 Sck, 2 FF, 1 FR.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 16</h2><h3>Wraiths - 24, Hawks - 16<br />      Liberty - 38, Yeti - 31<br />      SaberCats - 27, Otters - 13<br />      Butchers - 33, Silverbacks - 21<br />      Copperheads - 37, Fire Salamanders - 17<br />      Hahalua - 34, Second Line - 17<br />      Outlaws - 28, Sailfish - 23</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Sarasota Sailfish at Arizona Outlaws</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />I do not think people realize how good this defense is. They are 2nd in run defense. Giving up only 74 yards per game. They are 2nd in forced fumbles. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />For this match up, a good bet is that Zamir Kehla - CB will shine for the Outlaws defense. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I find it hard to bet against coach Emery Gallant. He always has them well prepared. He is doing some really smart things on offense. He is running an explosive defense. You heard it here first. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />I do not think their offense gets enough credit. They are 5th in the league passing touchdowns with 25. They are 3rd in the league rushing touchdowns with 18. They are 4th in the league rushing yards per game. They average 118.8! They are 2nd in the league points scored per game. They average 29.5! <br /></h3><h2>Second Line racking up yards!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>The offense of the Second Line is whipping the tail off everybody this year, posting 5383 total yards and 394 points thus far in 14 games. Quarterback Ben Slothlisberger - QB and receiver Ed Barker - WR have hooked up to the tune of 1318 yards this season, while Running Back Marcella Toriki - RB has plowed his way  for 1458. The hogs on the line has crushed the opposition for 432 pancakes this season while surrendering only 6 quarterback sacks.</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Gunner Thorbjornsson (R) (ARI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Week 15's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Gunner Thorbjornsson (R). His 22 att, 135 yds, 2 TD performance stood out in the 28 to 24 victory for the Arizona Outlaws.<br /><br />    The former Oregon gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 1050 Yards and 10 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Greedy Sly calls out Yeti Head Coach Reinhardt after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>Greedy Sly was angry about the game against Donald Reinhardt. Moreover, he denied that the players were at fault. Greedy Sly - CB was clearly upset in the Yeti loss. 'We learned a lot. We learned a lot about our coaches. We realized that there is a reason we are losing. I am not sure what Donald Reinhardt saw in his preparation, but he has to do a better job at Head Coach', the CB said.</h3><h2>Week 15: CB Greedy Sly (COL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>CB Sly's ball hawking ability was on display in the Yeti 34-14 game with the San Jose SaberCats. He finished with 6 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD.<br /><br />    "Greedy has the unique ability to make plays and generate turnovers." -Yeti Defensive Coordinator</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 15</h2><h3>Outlaws - 28, Hawks - 24<br />      Yeti - 34, SaberCats - 14<br />      Sailfish - 39, Butchers - 24<br />      Silverbacks - 24, Fire Salamanders - 19<br />      Hahalua - 42, Otters - 14<br />      Wraiths - 28, Copperheads - 23<br />      Liberty - 24, Second Line - 21</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Arizona Outlaws at Baltimore Hawks</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />You got to like this offense. They are 4th in the league in sacks allowed. They are 5th in the league rushing touchdowns with 14. Can't lose. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />This defense is likely to step up this week. They are 2nd in sacks with 37. They are 4th in pass defense. They only give up 239.6 per game. They are 3rd in the league in tackles for loss. This will be a very entertaining game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />Head coach Isidro Combs has this team running like a well oiled machine. He is running an explosive defense. This may be one for the ages. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />Looking at the two rosters, a good bet is that Donald Baker - DE will wreck havoc for the Hawks defense. <br /></h3><h2>Week 14: SS DB Jadakiss (ARI) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>SS DB Jadakiss of the Arizona Outlaws has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Jadakiss finished with 10 Tck, 2 Sck.</h3><h2>Week 14: RB Marcella Toriki (NOLA) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>Week 14's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Marcella Toriki.

'We have to step up, all of us.' he said. 'But some guys are not stepping up and we end up losing. They need to get their head in the game', he continued. 'We lost and somebody is to blame. If you look at the game, you will see some players just are not delivering.' said the Hawks DE. Asked to clarify, Goodman (R) suggested Korbin Brown (R) - WR needs to perform better, but underscored that there was plenty of blame to go around. 'Guys need to listen, we need to get grinding, you cannot just show up and expect to play or expect to win', Goodman (R) concluded.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 14</h2><h3>Hawks - 20, Yeti - 13<br />      Outlaws - 30, Liberty - 23<br />      Second Line - 43, Butchers - 38<br />      Sailfish - 31, Hahalua - 21<br />      Copperheads - 23, Silverbacks - 16<br />      SaberCats - 27, Fire Salamanders - 13</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Honolulu Hahalua at Sarasota Sailfish</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />We are doing a sweepstakes at the network, and I look forward to raking in the winnings for this bet. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />I see them winning again this week. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />In the context of this game, it seems obvious that Ray-Ray Jackson - CB will dominate the offense. This is going to be great to watch. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />Having team player who help coordinate everyone else is invaluable and definitely helps the Sailfish win this game. If you look at their roster, I see Bob Doe - G and None Beat - SS playing this kind of role. There are so many factors to consider when making predictions. This one was easy though. <br /></h3><h2>Week 13: QB George O'Donnell (CHI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>The league announced Chicago Butchers quarterback George O'Donnell has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Butchers defeated the Yellowknife Wraiths, 37 to 24.
