Sure, there are, were or will be someone who is better than me, but I feel confident that Osiris Firestorm-Fjord - CB is not one of them.' the 21 year old CB said.</h3><h2>Week 18: QB Jay Cue (C) (ARI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>The league announced Arizona Outlaws quarterback Jay Cue (C) has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Outlaws defeated the San Jose SaberCats, 34 to 27. Cue (C) did his part, throwing 4 touchdowns, completing 34 of 37 passes for 380 yards.

They are 4th in the league passing touchdowns with 36. They are 1st in the league in sacks allowed. They are 1st in the league points scored per game. They average 31.3! <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I see them winning again this week. You heard it here first. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I think their defense will carry them. They are 3rd in points allowed, averaging only 24.1. They are 1st in interceptions with 22. They are 4th in the league in tackles for loss. They are 2nd in forced fumbles. This will be a very up and down affair. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, I think that Tyron Brackenridge (C) - LB is the guy to watch, this man is pivotal to the SaberCats defense. If they do not win, I have to buy cake for the entire office. That is how sure I am. <br /></h3><h2>Logan Noble Jr. taunts the Liberty after Outlaws victory.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Logan Noble Jr. did not hold back when asked about the Outlaws after their game. The Outlaws DE made no efforts to hide his lack of respect for the Liberty. 'I think this game proves where our team is, and that the Liberty just are not at our level', he said.</h3><h2>Week 17: QB George O'Donnell (CHI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>The league announced Chicago Butchers quarterback George O'Donnell has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Butchers defeated the Berlin Fire Salamanders, 38 to 36.

His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 37 to 16, and a passer rating of 102.6.</h3><h2>Week 17: CB Jordan Andrews (NYS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/14.png'>CB Jordan Andrews of the New York Silverbacks has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Andrews finished with 3 Tck, 2 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 17</h2><h3>Outlaws - 38, Yeti - 31<br />      SaberCats - 37, Wraiths - 17<br />      Hahalua - 23, Copperheads - 10<br />      Butchers - 38, Fire Salamanders - 36<br />      Hawks - 34, Second Line - 27<br />      Silverbacks - 33, Liberty - 19<br />      Sailfish - 31, Otters - 21</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Colorado Yeti at Arizona Outlaws</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, it seems obvious that the Outlaws got to love fielding an offense with Jay Cue (C) - QB. He will be critical this week, and is likely to be dominant. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Zamir Kehla - CB, Pete Miller - DT and Logan Noble Jr. - DE with their beautiful team play make the difference in this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />For this game, I feel certain that we cannot avoid mentioning Galf Wilf (C) - LB. He has been tearing it up so far this season. He will continue to do so today. I expect some incredible plays in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Head coach Emery Gallant has this team running like a well oiled machine. He makes great offensive adjustments. He is one of the best defensive minds. The referees will have their work cut out for them. This will be very competitive and intense. <br /></h3><h2>Second Line racking up yards!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>The offense of the Second Line is throwing up some serious yardage on everybody this year, posting 6296 total yards and 407 points thus far in 15 games. Quarterback Ben Slothlisberger - QB and receiver Ed Barker - WR have hooked up to the tune of 1301 yards this season, while Running Back Marcella Toriki - RB has piled up for 1536. The big boys up front has crushed the opposition for 534 pancakes this season while allowing only 8 quarterback sacks.</h3><h2>Who is the best WR? Butchers' Bender B. Rodriguez or Yeti' William Lim?</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>Butchers WR Bender B. Rodriguez compared himself to William Lim of the Yeti in a postgame interview. 'You cannot help but compare yourself to other players. Sure, there are, were or will be someone who is better than me, but I feel confident that William Lim - WR is not one of them.' the 21 year old WR said.</h3><h2>Week 16: QB Suleiman Ramza (R) (OCO) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>The league announced Orange County Otters quarterback Suleiman Ramza (R) has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Otters defeated the San Jose SaberCats, 38 to 34. Ramza (R) did his part, throwing 5 touchdowns, completing 28 of 41 passes for 457 yards. His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 37 to 14, and a passer rating of 106.6.</h3><h2>Week 16: CB Asher Quinn (BER) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>CB Asher Quinn of the Berlin Fire Salamanders has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Quinn finished with 7 Tck, 1 Sck, 1 Int, 1 FF.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 16</h2><h3>Wraiths - 28, Hawks - 25<br />      Yeti - 20, Liberty - 13<br />      Otters - 38, SaberCats - 34<br />      Silverbacks - 24, Butchers - 22<br />      Fire Salamanders - 37, Copperheads - 32<br />      Hahalua - 26, Second Line - 17<br />      Sailfish - 38, Outlaws - 24</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Sarasota Sailfish at Arizona Outlaws</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />Having team player who help coordinate everyone else is invaluable and definitely helps the Sailfish win this game. If you look at their roster, I see Bob Doe - G and None Beat - SS playing this kind of role. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />We are doing a sweepstakes at the network, and I look forward to raking in the winnings for this bet. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />They will rely on their offense to pull them through. They are 4th in the league passing touchdowns with 30. They are 1st in the league in sacks allowed. They are 1st in the league points scored per game. They average 31.3! <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />In the context of this game, I think a good bet is that Joseph Michel - RB is a key cog in the offensive machinery of the Outlaws. Should be interesting to see him going against a quality opponent. This is going to be a very viewer friendly game. <br /></h3><h2>Yellowknife Wraiths surprise everyone!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>The Yellowknife Wraiths fans are celebrating after the Wraiths took down the Austin Copperheads.<br />In a superb effort the Wraiths kept at it, and brought home the win. The Copperheads are widely considered to be the better of the two programs, but with the Wraiths winning the fans are hoping that the Wraiths will soon be able to dance with the big boys.</h3><h2>Wesley Eriksen blasts the Liberty in aftermath of Liberty loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>Wesley Eriksen was angry in his postgame interview after the Liberty' loss. 'I think we were the best team on the field. You know, the Liberty can point to the result all they want, but they did not deserve to win this.</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Raphtalia Chan (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>The honor comes after Chan's 15 att, 145 yds, 2 TD performance against the Chicago Butchers. Chan from UCF was selected in round 0, 5 years ago.<br /><br />    Chan now has 1360 Rushing Yards and 13 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 15: FS Magnus Valdyr (YKW) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>FS Magnus Valdyr of the Yellowknife Wraiths has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Valdyr finished with 3 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 15</h2><h3>Outlaws - 38, Hawks - 20<br />      Yeti - 28, SaberCats - 21<br />      Sailfish - 31, Butchers - 28<br />      Silverbacks - 30, Fire Salamanders - 24<br />      Otters - 34, Hahalua - 3<br />      Wraiths - 36, Copperheads - 17<br />      Liberty - 35, Second Line - 31</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Arizona Outlaws at Baltimore Hawks</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />In this game, I see no way in which you can discount that Ben Stackinpaper - CB will be a key figure in this game. There is a reason they are paying him this much. They will expect him to deliver this week. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />They have a dominant offense. They do not get enough credit for that. They are 1st in the league passing touchdowns with 30. They are 1st in the league passing yards per game. They average 312.7! They are maulers, 5th in the league in pancakes. They are 5th in the league average yards per rush. They are 5th in the league rushing touchdowns with 14. They are 3rd in the league points scored per game. They average 30.6! <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />This will be a tough game and that is where playing as a team comes in. They will need to rely on people such as Zamir Kehla - CB and Pete Miller - DT who are great at coordinating and making sure everyone is doing the right thing on the field. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />With leaders like Eldrick Avery - CB and Doug Howlett (R) - WR in the locker room it is easy to see why the Hawks win this game. <br /></h3><h2>Michael Witheblock calls out Sailfish DE Goku after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Michael Witheblock was furious with his team in an interview after the Sailfish lost. He called out the effort on both offense and defense. 'These guys, they do not seem hungry. We have to get on the same page. Are we doing this or not?', he complained. 'Man, I think a bunch of guys let us down. I could point the finger at many.' the 21 year old WR said. Later in the interview he seemed to indicate that Son Goku - DE was one of the players he had in mind.</h3><h2>Week 14: RB Zoe Watts (R) (AUS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>Week 14's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Zoe Watts (R). His 16 att, 118 yds, 2 TD performance stood out in the 28 to 17 victory for the Austin Copperheads.<br /><br />    The former Stanford gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 996 Yards and 12 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 14: DT Magnus Rikiya (NOLA) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>DT Magnus Rikiya of the New Orleans Second Line has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Rikiya finished with 7 Tck, 2 Sck, 2 FF, 2 FR.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 14</h2><h3>Hawks - 49, Yeti - 20<br />      Outlaws - 17, Liberty - 16<br />      Second Line - 36, Butchers - 7<br />      Hahalua - 23, Sailfish - 20<br />      Copperheads - 28, Silverbacks - 17<br />      Fire Salamanders - 28, SaberCats - 23</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Philadelphia Liberty at Arizona Outlaws</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I am sure head coach Emery Gallant has something up his sleeve for this game. He is doing some really smart things on offense. He is running an explosive defense. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />The difference in this game will be their defense. They are 4th in points allowed, averaging only 23.3. They are 4th in pass defense. They only give up 256.6 per game. They are 1st in interceptions with 16. They are 4th in the league in tackles for loss. They are 1st in forced fumbles. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />For this game, I am confident that Zamir Kehla - CB is the kind of player who gives offensive coordinators nightmares. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />For this match up, you would be a fool not to think Sam Torenson - RB has to potential to carry the Liberty offense.

The referees will have their work cut out for them. This will be very competitive and intense. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />Deshun Jones (C) - LB. Team player! Garfield Despacito Jr. - WR. Team player! Alain Johns - G. Team player! The Otters play as a unit, and get the win. A double digit win. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />In this game, my view is that Sam Torenson - RB is going to be a difference maker on the Liberty offense. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Orange County Otters</b><br />In this game, I think a good bet is that Deshun Jones (C) - LB is the kind of player who will give the offense nightmares. A double digit win. <br /></h3><h2>Chris Kross consoles Wraiths after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>Chris Kross was not pessimistic in an interview after the Wraiths lost to the Hawks.
