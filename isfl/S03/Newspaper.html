He is having a great season. Look for him to continue padding his stats this week. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />Surely, the Sailfish win. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />They field one of the most underestimated defenses. They are 4th in points allowed, averaging only 24.1. They are 5th in run defense. Giving up only 88.9 yards per game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Austin Copperheads</b><br />They play great together. Having a guy like Easton Cole (C) - QB on the field who understands what everyone needs to do and helping them play as a unit will help them a great deal in this game. Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /></h3><h2>Dissatisfaction after Fire Salamanders-Second Line game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>Hank Steel (C) was angry in his postgame interview after the Fire Salamanders' loss. The Fire Salamanders DT said he lost all respect for the Fire Salamanders. 'I think this game proves that sometimes teams get lucky in this league, and that the Fire Salamanders just got lucky', he said.</h3><h2>Week 17: RB Joseph Petrongolo (BER) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>The honor comes after Petrongolo's 21 att, 153 yds, 2 TD, 3 rec, 15 yds, 1 TD performance against the Chicago Butchers. Petrongolo from Vanderbilt was selected in round 0, 3 years ago.<br /><br />    Petrongolo now has 1438 Rushing Yards and 15 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 17: SS Benoit Blanco (BER) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>SS Benoit Blanco of the Berlin Fire Salamanders has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Blanco finished with 7 Tck, 1 Sck, 1 Def TD, 1 FF, 1 FR.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 17</h2><h3>Yeti - 42, Outlaws - 28<br />      SaberCats - 26, Wraiths - 21<br />      Copperheads - 27, Hahalua - 13<br />      Fire Salamanders - 41, Butchers - 23<br />      Second Line - 23, Hawks - 17<br />      Liberty - 33, Silverbacks - 24<br />      Sailfish - 31, Otters - 24</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Austin Copperheads at Honolulu Hahalua</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />This should be obvious to anyone who looks a the teams. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Austin Copperheads</b><br />Team play. Playing as a unit. You cannot discount the difference it makes. I am thinking of a guy like Easton Cole (C) - QB. Playing as a team is what gets them the win. You heard it here first. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />They will win again this week. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />Their offense will step up this game. They are 1st in the league pass completion percentage. If they lose this one, I will never hear the end of it. <br /></h3><h2>Yellowknife Wraiths upset the Baltimore Hawks!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>The Yellowknife Wraiths fans are celebrating after the Wraiths took down the Baltimore Hawks.<br />In a superb effort the Wraiths kept at it, and brought home the win. The Hawks are widely considered to be the better of the two programs, but with the Wraiths winning the fans are hoping that the Wraiths will soon be able to dance with the big boys.</h3><h2>Honda Edmond ridicules the Fire Salamanders.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>Honda Edmond was pretty blunt in his postgame interview after the Copperheads's win. The Copperheads LB made no efforts to hide his lack of respect for the Fire Salamanders. 'I think this game proves where our team is, and that the Fire Salamanders just are not at our level', he said.</h3><h2>Week 16: QB Easton Cole (C) (AUS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>The Austin Copperheads' Easton Cole (C) threw 4 touchdowns, completing 33 of 45 passes for 379 yards in the Copperheads victory over the Berlin Fire Salamanders.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 10 for Cole (C), has seen some impressive numbers including 26 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 16: FS Pete Parker (COL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>FS Pete Parker of the Colorado Yeti has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Parker finished with 5 Tck, 2 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 16</h2><h3>Wraiths - 33, Hawks - 10<br />      Yeti - 41, Liberty - 13<br />      Otters - 23, SaberCats - 21<br />      Butchers - 21, Silverbacks - 20<br />      Copperheads - 44, Fire Salamanders - 24<br />      Second Line - 34, Hahalua - 19<br />      Outlaws - 27, Sailfish - 24</h3><h2>Game of the Week: New Orleans Second Line at Honolulu Hahalua</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />This is a very good defense. They are 1st in points allowed, averaging only 21.3. They are 3rd in pass defense. They only give up 244.7 per game. They are 2nd in run defense. Giving up only 81.1 yards per game. They are 3rd in the league in tackles for loss. They are 1st in the league pass average yards per rush. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />I think having a team players like Medicinal Toblerone (R) - DE is the kind of thing that will help the Second Line win this game. This will either be wildly entertaining or a dull grind. I see no middle between the two. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />Look for them to continue their winstreak. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />This is just going by my intuition. This may be a pivotal game for their season. <br /></h3><h2>Criticism of WR Doug Howlett (R) after Hawks-Outlaws game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>Gary Goodman (R) pointed the finger at his fellow Hawks players after they lost. 'We have to step up, all of us.' he said. 'But some guys are not stepping up and we end up losing. They need to get their head in the game', he continued. 'Man, I think a bunch of guys let us down. I could point the finger at many.' the 21 year old DE said. Later in the interview he seemed to indicate that Doug Howlett (R) - WR was one of the players he had in mind.</h3><h2>Week 15: QB Luke Skywalker (C) (HON) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>The Honolulu Hahalua' Luke Skywalker (C) threw 4 touchdowns, completing 29 of 41 passes for 319 yards in the Hahalua victory over the Orange County Otters.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 4 for Skywalker (C), has seen some impressive numbers including 23 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 15: LB Mack Arianlacher (AUS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>LB Mack Arianlacher of the Austin Copperheads has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Arianlacher finished with 10 Tck, 1 Sck, 2 FF, 2 FR.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 15</h2><h3>Outlaws - 29, Hawks - 28<br />      SaberCats - 27, Yeti - 24<br />      Butchers - 24, Sailfish - 6<br />      Silverbacks - 34, Fire Salamanders - 14<br />      Hahalua - 28, Otters - 14<br />      Copperheads - 41, Wraiths - 7<br />      Second Line - 20, Liberty - 10</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Arizona Outlaws at Baltimore Hawks</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />For this game, my opinion is that The Outlaws rely on Desmond Scarlett - CB on their defense. Big names make big plays in big games, I cannot wait to watch this. Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />People tend to underestimate their offense. They are 2nd in the league in sacks allowed. They are maulers, 4th in the league in pancakes. They are 4th in the league in passes of more than 20 yards. They are 4th in the league rushing touchdowns with 16. They are 5th in the league points scored per game. They average 28.9! <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />They will get back in the winning column this week. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Leadership matters in games like this. And when I look at the Outlaws and the leaders they have - Zamir Kehla - CB, Pete Miller - DT and Logan Noble Jr. - DE - I think this gets them the win. This will really be a statement win. <br /></h3><h2>Philadelphia Liberty take home the upset victory!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>The Philadelphia Liberty surprises everyone with an unlikely road win against Arizona Outlaws.<br />The Outlaws never manage to take control of the game, while the Liberty kept grinding and drove the victory home. The Outlaws players had expected an easy victory, and this will be a bitter loss and a tough blow to the self-respect of the program. Meanwhile the Liberty fans are ecstatic and are already entertaining thoughts about a cinderella future.</h3><h2>Week 14: RB Marcella Toriki (NOLA) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>Week 14's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Marcella Toriki. His 22 att, 115 yds, 3 TD performance stood out in the 42 to 26 victory for the New Orleans Second Line.<br /><br />    The former Oregon gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 1335 Yards and 15 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 14: DE Tex Wrecks (R) (PHI) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>DE Tex Wrecks (R) of the Philadelphia Liberty has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

They might even blow them out. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />In the context of this game, a good bet is that Ben Stackinpaper - CB is a key cog in the defensive machinery of the Hawks. Should be interesting to see him going against a quality opponent. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />One of the most underestimated defenses. They are 4th in points allowed, averaging only 23.8. They are 1st in pass defense. They only give up 232.6 per game. They are 2nd in interceptions with 14. They are 3rd in forced fumbles. Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />In the context of this game, it seems obvious that you have to look at this LB named Derred De Ville (C). I expect everyone knows this guy will be a wrecking ball. <br /></h3><h2>Yellowknife Wraiths pull off the upset!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>With an outstanding effort the Yellowknife Wraiths pull off the upset against Chicago Butchers.<br />Everyone had expected the Chicago Butchers to handle the Yellowknife Wraiths with easy, but the Wraiths just wanted it more. This was really a must win game for the Butchers, and the loss will surely put a dent in their confidence.</h3><h2>Winning pleases everyone.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/14.png'>Silverbacks fans are celebrating this week after their team mopped the floor with the Second Line.

The former Round 0 selection is racking up the receiving yards, bringing his season total to 941 yards on the season.</h3><h2>Room blasts Brock Bodenhamer (R) - WR in wake of Second Line loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>White Room was furious with his team in an interview after the Second Line lost. He called out the effort on both offense and defense. 'These guys, they do not seem hungry. We have to get on the same page. Are we doing this or not?', he complained.
