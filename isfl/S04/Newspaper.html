You can quote me on that. There will be some wild plays in this game. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />For this game, my gut tells me that Brokk Lee - G will shine for the SaberCats offense. They rely on him, and he will deliver. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I do not think their defense gets enough credit. They are 3rd in sacks with 48. They are 3rd in points allowed, averaging only 21.7. They are 5th in pass defense. They only give up 256.2 per game. They are 3rd in run defense. Giving up only 84.1 yards per game. They are 3rd in the league in tackles for loss. It might be a high scoring game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />It may come down to the wire though. <br /></h3><h2>Julio Jones consoles Outlaws after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Julio Jones was optimistic in his postgame interview after the loss to the Hawks. The Outlaws T said he saw good things from his team in the game against the Hawks. 'We proved this game that we have it in us. We came close and we showed what we are all about. This team is hungry, and I think there are good things in there future.', he said.</h3><h2>Week 17: RB Joseph Petrongolo (BER) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>Week 17's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Joseph Petrongolo.

Look for him to dominate. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Colorado Yeti</b><br />Head coach Donald Reinhardt puts them over the top in this game. He is doing some clever things with his defense. I see a lot of points being scored in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I really like their offense. They are 1st in the league passing touchdowns with 30. They are 2nd in the league in sacks allowed. They are 5th in the league rushing touchdowns with 13. They are 4th in the league points scored per game. They average 26.1! A close win. <br /></h3><h2>Week 16: QB Nick Kaepercolin (BER) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>The Berlin Fire Salamanders' Nick Kaepercolin threw 5 touchdowns, completing 28 of 38 passes for 308 yards in the Fire Salamanders victory over the Austin Copperheads.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 4 for Kaepercolin, has seen some impressive numbers including 24 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Copperheads lost. Copperheads has something to say about that.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>Friedrich Vequain (R) pointed fingers when asked about the loss to Copperheads. Friedrich Vequain (R) - WR left no possibility for mistakes about his opinion of the Copperheads. 'The Copperheads' players should care more about how they carry themselves. Instead they were acting like classless clowns', a clearly bitter Vequain (R) said.</h3><h2>Week 16: LB Haha Mango-Panda (SAR) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>LB Haha Mango-Panda of the Sarasota Sailfish has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Mango-Panda finished with 12 Tck, 1 Sfty, 3 FF.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 16</h2><h3>Wraiths - 27, Hawks - 10<br />      Yeti - 24, Liberty - 20<br />      SaberCats - 36, Otters - 21<br />      Butchers - 16, Silverbacks - 11<br />      Fire Salamanders - 40, Copperheads - 27<br />      Hahalua - 27, Second Line - 22<br />      Outlaws - 21, Sailfish - 15</h3><h2>Game of the Week: New Orleans Second Line at Honolulu Hahalua</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />You got to like this offense. They are 5th in the league pass completion percentage. They are 1st in the league passing touchdowns with 30. They are 5th in the league passing yards per game. They average 271! They are 5th in the league in sacks allowed. They are maulers, 3rd in the league in pancakes. They are 3rd in the league average yards per rush. They are 5th in the league rushing touchdowns with 12. They are 5th in the league rushing yards per game. They average 110.8! They are 1st in the league points scored per game. They average 28.1! <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />Looking at the teams, I am certain that David Rector - CB is the guy to watch, this man is pivotal to the Second Line defense. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />This will be a tough game and that is where playing as a team comes in. They will need to rely on people such as Luke Skywalker (C) - QB and Buck Thornton - SS who are great at coordinating and making sure everyone is doing the right thing on the field. A close win. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />The leadership on this team is great. Having a guy like Medicinal Toblerone (R) - DE on the field and in the locker room is exactly what you need to win games like this. <br /></h3><h2>Baltimore Hawks upset the Arizona Outlaws!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>With an outstanding effort the Baltimore Hawks pull off the upset against Arizona Outlaws.<br />Everyone had expected the Arizona Outlaws to handle the Baltimore Hawks with easy, but the Hawks just wanted it more. This was really a must win game for the Outlaws, and the loss will surely put a dent in their confidence.</h3><h2>Pak not down after Otters close loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Yong-sun Pak was frank and upbeat about the game against Outlaws in an interview after the game. 'I think we played well and showed some things. The Outlaws are a good team and we played them well. There is plenty of promise on this roster, and we will be back and get them next time. Until then it is all about working hard to get there.' the 22 year old G said.</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Marcella Toriki (NOLA) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>Week 15's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Marcella Toriki. His 16 att, 162 yds, 1 TD, 3 rec, 13 yds, 1 TD performance stood out in the 31 to 13 victory for the New Orleans Second Line.<br /><br />    The former Oregon gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 1348 Yards and 5 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 15: FS Pete Parker (COL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>FS Pete Parker of the Colorado Yeti has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

They are 4th in the league rushing yards per game. They average 112.8! <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />In the context of this game, I think that Tychondrius Hood - WR will be a key figure in this game. The SaberCats offense relies on him. This will be watercooler talk on monday. Do not miss it. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />They play great together. Having a guy like Jamar Lackson - RB on the field who understands what everyone needs to do and helping them play as a unit will help them a great deal in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Colorado Yeti</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, it is likely that Greedy Sly - CB is the guy to watch, this man is pivotal to the Yeti defense. <br /></h3><h2>Week 14: DE Lawrence Bass (SJS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>DE Bass absolutely dominated in the SaberCats 25-18 game with the Berlin Fire Salamanders.

He is getting paid a lot of money to carry games. Lots of points scored. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />The SaberCats have really strong team play. You look at a player like Jamar Lackson - RB and what he does for a team. He makes everyone around him better. We will be talking about this game for a long time. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />I see them winning again this week. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Berlin Fire Salamanders</b><br />For this game, the film shows that you cannot keep Swantavius Jones (R) - CB down for an entire game. Eventually he will come out of the blue and make a big play. <br /></h3><h2>Cole (C) optimistic despite Copperheads loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>Easton Cole (C) was not pessimistic in an interview after the Copperheads lost to the Outlaws.

If you look at their roster, I see Zamir Kehla - CB and Pete Miller - DT playing this kind of role. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I think their defense will carry them. They are 4th in sacks with 31. They are 3rd in points allowed, averaging only 21.8. They are 5th in pass defense. They only give up 260.2 per game. They are 1st in run defense. Giving up only 75.8 yards per game. They are 3rd in the league in tackles for loss. Just win baby. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Orange County Otters</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, you can make the argument that Hunter Harrison - T always has an impact. The defense will have to gameplan for him if they want to stand even the slightest chance. <br /></h3><h2>Chris Kross calls out Wraiths TE Rechs (R) after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>Chris Kross pointed the finger at his fellow Wraiths players after they lost.

You pick and drill, and I would gladly show how wrong they are' said the Second Line C. He added: 'Sure, I do not want to be mean, The Block is a decent C, but seriously just look at the tape'.</h3><h2>Week 3: CB HeHateMe PickSix (SJS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>CB PickSix's ball hawking ability was on display in the SaberCats 25-8 game with the Yellowknife Wraiths. He finished with 9 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD.<br /><br />    "HeHateMe has the unique ability to make plays and generate turnovers." -SaberCats Defensive Coordinator</h3><h2>Week 3: RB Ashley Owens (NYS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/14.png'>Week 3's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Ashley Owens.

When I look at guys like Zamir Kehla - CB, Pete Miller - DT and Logan Noble Jr. - DE it is easy to see why they win tough games like this. This will either be wildly entertaining or a dull grind. I see no middle between the two. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />Their win streak will not be broken in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Looking at the two rosters, you would be a fool not to think Zamir Kehla - CB is the kind of player who gives offensive coordinators nightmares. <br /></h3><h2>Week 2: QB Jay Cue (C) (ARI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>The Arizona Outlaws' Jay Cue (C) threw 3 touchdowns, completing 32 of 43 passes for 351 yards in the Outlaws victory over the Colorado Yeti.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 8 for Cue (C), has seen some impressive numbers including 3 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Sparks fly after Second Line-Wraiths game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>Andrew Witten did not hold back when asked about the Second Line after their game.

With team players like Bob Doe - G and None Beat - SS who make everyone around them better, how could they not? <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New York Silverbacks</b><br />I think their offense will carry them. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />Looking at the teams, it is likely that the Sailfish' defense goes through Harrison Andrews (R) - CB. This man has the ability to change games. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Sarasota Sailfish</b><br />We are doing a sweepstakes at the network, and I look forward to raking in the winnings for this bet. <br /></h3><h2>Heinrich Kackpoo consoles Hahalua after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>Heinrich Kackpoo was optimistic in his postgame interview after the loss to the Copperheads.

You heard it here first. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Warren Swamp Bats</b><br />Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Charleston Jazz</b><br />For this game, it should be clear that Rickie Vaughne (R) - CB needs to show up, but if he does the Jazz will be shutting people down. <br /></h3><h2>G William Bills (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>G William Bills (47 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>CB Simon Dominguez (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>CB Simon Dominguez (50 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>CB Bertram Harms (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>CB Bertram Harms (35 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>Post Free Agency Retirements</h2><h3>The following players have retired after going unsigned through free agency:</h3><h2>DT Donald Hopper (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>DT Donald Hopper (40 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>Free Agency Round 10:  Round Up</h2><h3>42 players signed this week.<br /><br />The biggest name signing this week was Phillip Forrest.
