Cue (C) did his part, throwing 5 touchdowns, completing 24 of 34 passes for 308 yards. His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 40 to 11, and a passer rating of 108.4.</h3><h2>Week 18: CB Ben Stackinpaper (BAL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>CB Stackinpaper's ball hawking ability was on display in the Hawks 47-21 game with the Orange County Otters. He finished with 4 Tck, 2 Int, 1 Def TD.<br /><br />    "Ben has the unique ability to make plays and generate turnovers." -Hawks Defensive Coordinator</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 18</h2><h3>Wraiths - 24, Liberty - 22<br />      Hawks - 47, Otters - 21<br />      Outlaws - 51, SaberCats - 21<br />      Copperheads - 36, Sailfish - 24<br />      Hahalua - 37, Butchers - 17<br />      Silverbacks - 20, Fire Salamanders - 17</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Arizona Outlaws at San Jose SaberCats</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I do not think you get very far against their defense. They are 4th in sacks with 40. They are 2nd in interceptions with 16. They are 2nd in the league in tackles for loss. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />The SaberCats have really strong team play. You look at a player like Jamar Lackson - RB and what he does for a team. He makes everyone around him better. This will be a great game to watch. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />This offense is likely to step up this week. They are 4th in the league pass completion percentage. They are 2nd in the league passing touchdowns with 35. They are 1st in the league in sacks allowed. They are 1st in the league points scored per game. They average 29.3! I see a lot of points being scored in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, you would be a fool not to think that Desmond Scarlett will be dominant here. The young CB is going to destroy the offense. This may be where we see their true colors. <br /></h3><h2>No Pass Zone in Yellowknife.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>Wraiths pass defense this year has been spot-on this season, giving up only 3370 in 15 games. Said one defensive coach, ‘To get a group of guys to play like that, that is what every defensive minded coach dreams of.’.</h3><h2>Susan Cash Jr. (C) takes aim at the Fire Salamanders.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>Susan Cash Jr. (C) was not happy in an interview after the Fire Salamanders lost to the Fire Salamanders. 'Surely, we have to take responsibility, but they were playing dirty, and it is a testament to their character' said the Fire Salamanders Susan Cash Jr. (C) - WR. He continued: 'The Fire Salamanders' players will likely take offense to this, but I do not care. It is what it is, they did not deserve to win'.'</h3><h2>Week 17: RB Raphtalia Chan (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Week 17's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Raphtalia Chan. His 22 att, 179 yds, 2 TD, 2 rec, 77 yds, 1 TD performance stood out in the 49 to 23 victory for the Sarasota Sailfish.<br /><br />    The former UCF gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 1570 Yards and 13 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 17: CB Rashad Hilliard (R) (SJS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>CB Hilliard (R)'s ball hawking ability was on display in the SaberCats 36-23 game with the Yellowknife Wraiths. He finished with 4 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD, 1 FF.<br /><br />    "Rashad has the unique ability to make plays and generate turnovers." -SaberCats Defensive Coordinator</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 17</h2><h3>Outlaws - 37, Yeti - 31<br />      SaberCats - 36, Wraiths - 23<br />      Copperheads - 27, Hahalua - 27<br />      Fire Salamanders - 30, Butchers - 22<br />      Second Line - 41, Hawks - 17<br />      Liberty - 23, Silverbacks - 20<br />      Sailfish - 49, Otters - 23</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Colorado Yeti at Arizona Outlaws</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I find it hard to bet against coach Emery Gallant. He always has them well prepared. He is running a great offense. Defensively he makes great adjustments. You heard it here first. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I really think having so strong and vocal leaders like Zamir Kehla - CB and Pete Miller - DT in the locker room and on the field is invaluable and definitely helps the Outlaws win this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />This is just what my gut tells me. Lots of points scored. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />For this game, I cannot help by think that Jerome Unk - G is the guy to watch, this man is pivotal to the Outlaws offense. <br /></h3><h2>Second Line racking up yards!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>The offense of the Second Line is whipping the tail off everybody this year, posting 5866 total yards and 407 points thus far in 15 games. Quarterback Ben Slothlisberger - QB and receiver Ed Barker - WR have hooked up to the tune of 1320 yards this season, while Running Back Marcella Toriki - RB has piled up for 1459. The big boys up front has smashed opponents for 515 pancakes this season while surrendering only 11 quarterback sacks.</h3><h2>Outlaws' Stanislaw Koniecpolski has an opinion on who is the best LB</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Outlaws LB Stanislaw Koniecpolski compared himself to Douglas Quaid of the Wraiths in a postgame interview. The Outlaws player remarks came in response to some online speculation about who was the better LB. 'I think I have proved what I am. I feel confident about where I am, but I think maybe Douglas Quaid has a little more he needs to prove, if you get me? At least if he want to be compared to me.', he said.</h3><h2>Week 16: QB Brock Phoenix (C) (PHI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>The league announced Philadelphia Liberty quarterback Brock Phoenix (C) has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Yeti defeated the Philadelphia Liberty, 38 to 34. Phoenix (C) did his part, throwing 4 touchdowns, completing 36 of 41 passes for 466 yards. His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 22 to 12, and a passer rating of 86.6.</h3><h2>Week 16: LB Douglas Quaid (YKW) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>LB Douglas Quaid of the Yellowknife Wraiths has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Quaid finished with 14 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD, 1 FF, 2 FR.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 16</h2><h3>Wraiths - 24, Hawks - 23<br />      Yeti - 38, Liberty - 34<br />      Otters - 34, SaberCats - 13<br />      Butchers - 20, Silverbacks - 7<br />      Copperheads - 55, Fire Salamanders - 31<br />      Second Line - 38, Hahalua - 31<br />      Outlaws - 45, Sailfish - 24</h3><h2>Game of the Week: New Orleans Second Line at Honolulu Hahalua</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />I see them winning again this week. A single digit win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />Do not sleep on this defense. They are 2nd in points allowed, averaging only 18.8. They are 1st in pass defense. They only give up 214.2 per game. They are 5th in run defense. Giving up only 95.5 yards per game. They are 1st in interceptions with 20. They greatly outscore them here. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, certainly they will struggle with containing players like David Rector - CB. Expect him to show up in a big way. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />Luke Skywalker (C) - QB. Buck Thornton - SS. Davriel Lavigne (R) - FS. Team players! With guys who can gell like that, they get wins. <br /></h3><h2>Trouble for Baltimore Hawks.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>It is not looking good in Baltimore owing to their 3-10-0 record this season. Many inside and outside the building are calling for a major house cleaning after this debacle sooner rather than later.</h3><h2>Week 15: QB Jay Cue (C) (ARI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>The Arizona Outlaws' Jay Cue (C) threw 4 touchdowns, completing 28 of 37 passes for 371 yards in the Outlaws victory over the Baltimore Hawks.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 8 for Cue (C), has seen some impressive numbers including 27 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 15: LB Mike Hockhertz (CHI) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>LB Hockhertz absolutely dominated in the Butchers 44-41 game with the Sarasota Sailfish. He finished with 7 Tck, 1 Sck, 2 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 15</h2><h3>Outlaws - 34, Hawks - 31<br />      Yeti - 21, SaberCats - 6<br />      Butchers - 44, Sailfish - 41<br />      Fire Salamanders - 23, Silverbacks - 17<br />      Hahalua - 37, Otters - 24<br />      Copperheads - 28, Wraiths - 17<br />      Second Line - 35, Liberty - 33</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Honolulu Hahalua at Orange County Otters</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Orange County Otters</b><br />This is just what my gut tells me. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />This week, the Hahalua will will need to come together as a team to win. Players like Luke Skywalker (C) - QB and Buck Thornton - SS who have great team playing skills and understand what everyone needs to to will be pivotal for this. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />You just have to look at their defense. They are 3rd in interceptions with 12. They are 3rd in the league in tackles for loss. They are 3rd in forced fumbles. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Orange County Otters</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, I think a good bet is that they have to contain Lord Beerus - CB. I think they will fail. Expect him to show up in a big way and make a difference. <br /></h3><h2>Trouble for Philadelphia Liberty.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>Pressure is mounting in Philadelphia owing to their 4-8-0 record this season. Many inside and outside the building are calling for some serious soul searching after this season.</h3><h2>Hawks victory feels good to Howlett (R).</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>No mincing of words from Doug Howlett (R) after the Hawks beat the Liberty. 'That was a pretty poor showing on their part' said the Doug Howlett (R) - WR Hawks. Continuing with details about the Liberty's players missed tackles and lack of communication Howlett (R) did not hold back. He will surely have put off several Liberty fans, as well as people in his own front office.</h3><h2>Week 14: QB Monterey Jack (SJS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>The San Jose SaberCats' Monterey Jack threw 4 touchdowns, completing 18 of 24 passes for 398 yards in the Fire Salamanders victory over the San Jose SaberCats.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 4 for Jack, has seen some impressive numbers including 24 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 14: LB Heinrich Kackpoo (HON) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>LB Kackpoo absolutely dominated in the Hahalua 34-3 game with the Sarasota Sailfish.

They do not get enough credit for that. They are 4th in points allowed, averaging only 22.5. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Chicago Butchers</b><br />I have to think the leadership in the locker room and on the field, and here I am thinking of players like Perry Tucker Jr. - T, Hamish MacAndrew - SS and Juan Domine (R) - LB is what will make the difference in this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Chicago Butchers</b><br />The Butchers really gell on the field. They play as a unit and that gets them the win this week. You only need to look at guys like Perry Tucker Jr. - T and Juan Domine (R) - LB to see the importance. Team players like that helps you win games. This game will be so very entertaining. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />Looking at the teams, there is no way around that Quenton Bode (C) - LB will not be a key player. He is hard to gameplan for. You blink for a second and he has taken over the game. If they do not win, I have to buy cake for the entire office. That is how sure I am. <br /></h3><h2>Pooky complains after Wraiths loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>Samson Pooky was not happy in an interview after the Wraiths lost to the Wraiths.

This will be a very up and down affair. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />People tend to underestimate their offense. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />People tend to underestimate their defense. Boy, oh boy am I looking forward to this. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Orange County Otters</b><br />All aboard the Otters hypetrain. <br /></h3><h2>Abernathy delighted after Otters victory.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Korrin Abernathy was pretty blunt in his postgame interview after the Otters's win. 'That was a pretty poor showing on their part' said the Korrin Abernathy - CB Otters. Continuing with details about the Yeti's players missed tackles and lack of communication Abernathy did not hold back. He will surely have put off several Yeti fans, as well as people in his own front office.</h3><h2>Week 2: RB Zoe Watts (R) (AUS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>The honor comes after Watts (R)'s 10 att, 173 yds, 2 TD performance against the Chicago Butchers.

Head coach Timothy Thomas is doing great things. There are so many factors to consider when making predictions. This one was easy though. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />Leadership. You cannot discount the difference it makes. I am thinking of a guy like Rapid Eagle - DT. He will lead the way and help them win. But it will be much closer than many think.. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />Looking at the two rosters, it is likely that Wesley Eriksen - SS can take over the game. Looking at the Liberty defense, it is clear that when he shows up, it is always entertaining. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />Look for them to build on their last win. Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /></h3><h2>Week 1: QB Suleiman Ramza (R) (OCO) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>The Orange County Otters' Suleiman Ramza (R) threw 2 touchdowns, completing 19 of 26 passes for 416 yards in the Otters victory over the Colorado Yeti.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 4 for Ramza (R), has seen some impressive numbers including 2 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Thruster points fingers after Yeti loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>Dick Thruster seemed almost depressed in an interview after the Yeti lost to the Donald Reinhardt. He indicated that a big factor in the loss was the Yeti' coaching, that appeared one step behind at every turn. Dick Thruster - T was clearly upset in the Yeti loss. 'We learned a lot. We learned a lot about our coaches. We realized that there is a reason we are losing. I am not sure what Donald Reinhardt saw in his preparation, but he has to do a better job at Head Coach', the T said.</h3><h2>Week 1: DE Immanuel Blackstone (C) (COL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>DE Immanuel Blackstone (C) of the Colorado Yeti has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.
