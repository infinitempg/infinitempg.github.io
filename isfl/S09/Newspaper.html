They do not get enough credit for that. They are 2nd in the league passing touchdowns with 33. They are maulers, 4th in the league in pancakes. They are 2nd in the league rushing touchdowns with 16. They are 3rd in the league points scored per game. They average 28.5! <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Players like Zamir Kehla - CB, Pete Miller - DT and Logan Noble Jr. - DE with their incredible leadership make the difference in this game. This may be where we see their true colors. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />I love what they are doing in Arizona coaching-wise. Head coach Emery Gallant is a major reason they will win this game. He is has a really good understanding of what works offensively. He is one of the best defensive minds. This should be some good football. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />I think their defense will carry them. They are 2nd in sacks with 47. They are 2nd in points allowed, averaging only 20.2. They are 3rd in run defense. Giving up only 83.9 yards per game. They are 1st in the league pass average yards per rush. They are 2nd in forced fumbles. <br /></h3><h2>Week 17: QB Dexter Banks II (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>The league announced Sarasota Sailfish quarterback Dexter Banks II has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Sailfish defeated the Orange County Otters, 41 to 27.

They are 4th in points allowed, averaging only 22.3. They are 4th in pass defense. They only give up 244.3 per game. They are 1st in the league pass average yards per rush. Boy, oh boy am I looking forward to this. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />You have to think of the roles Doug Howlett (R) - WR and Nacho Fries - G play on this team. They are the players who make everyone work together as a team. Playing as a unit will ensure the Hawks win these difficult games. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />This is a very good offense. They are 2nd in the league average yards per rush. They are 1st in the league rushing touchdowns with 16. They are 2nd in the league rushing yards per game. They average 122.1! A double digit win. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />I see them winning again this week. <br /></h3><h2>Week 16: WR Future Trunks (OCO) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Trunks's 5 rec, 224 yds, 4 TD effort led the way for the Orange County Otters.

Have you been living under a rock? Expect a great game. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />Get your popcorn ready. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />I really like their offense.

They are 3rd in the league rushing touchdowns with 15. They are 1st in the league rushing yards per game. They average 137.2! They are 2nd in the league points scored per game. They average 29.5! A tough choice.

The Otters players had expected an easy victory, and this will be a bitter loss and a tough blow to the self-respect of the program. Meanwhile the Hahalua fans are ecstatic and are already entertaining thoughts about a cinderella future.</h3><h2>Who is the better SS?

He is getting paid a lot. The reason he is getting paid a lot is that he is really good. Do I need to say more?They will rack up a lot of points. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Orange County Otters</b><br />I have a lot of respect for head coach Jamie Eagle. He is doing great things in Orange County. He makes great offensive adjustments. This will be watercooler talk on monday. Do not miss it. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Orange County Otters</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, I see that the key is whether they can contain Suleiman Ramza (R) - QB. If not, he will destroy them. This will really be a statement win. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Orange County Otters</b><br />Their win streak will not be broken in this game. The way they win this game will tell a lot about what they are as a team. <br /></h3><h2>Karpaasi sees the bright side of Sailfish loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Mike Karpaasi was optimistic in his postgame interview after the loss to the Silverbacks.

He will have a great day and be critical in this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />Team play. Playing as a unit. You cannot discount the difference it makes. I am thinking of a guy like Jamar Lackson - RB.
