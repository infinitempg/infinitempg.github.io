'That was a pretty poor showing on their part' said the Skismai Woakneoa - G Sailfish. Continuing with details about the Silverbacks's players missed tackles and lack of communication Woakneoa did not hold back. He will surely have put off several Silverbacks fans, as well as people in his own front office.</h3><h2>Week 18: QB Colby Jack (YKW) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>The Yellowknife Wraiths' Colby Jack threw 2 touchdowns, completing 27 of 37 passes for 428 yards in the Wraiths victory over the Philadelphia Liberty.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 4 for Jack, has seen some impressive numbers including 27 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 18: LB Haha Mango-Panda (SAR) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>LB Haha Mango-Panda of the Sarasota Sailfish has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

They do not get enough credit for that. They are 1st in sacks with 50. They are 1st in points allowed, averaging only 20.3. They are 4th in run defense. Giving up only 85.7 yards per game. They are 4th in forced fumbles. A close win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Chicago Butchers</b><br />This will be a tough game and that is where leaders such as Perry Tucker Jr. - T and Hamish MacAndrew - SS will shine and help them get the win. Get your popcorn ready. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />This week, the Hahalua will will need to come together as a team to win. Players like Luke Skywalker (C) - QB and Buck Thornton - SS who have great team playing skills and understand what everyone needs to to will be pivotal for this. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Chicago Butchers</b><br />I know they lost their last game, but they will get the W this week. <br /></h3><h2>'I am better than Silverbacks' Donkey Kong', says Dieter Wall</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>When talking to reporters, at a galla event, G Dieter Wall made clear that he does not think Donkey Kong is 'all that'. The Fire Salamanders G said: 'Is he good? sure. Am I better? No question. I would wipe the floor with him any day'. 'You cannot help but compare yourself to other players. Sure, there are, were or will be someone who is better than me, but I feel confident that Donkey Kong - G is not one of them.' the 21 year old G said.</h3><h2>Week 17: RB Joseph Petrongolo (BER) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>The honor comes after Petrongolo's 16 att, 291 yds, 4 TD performance against the Chicago Butchers. Petrongolo from Vanderbilt was selected in round 0, 3 years ago.<br /><br />    Petrongolo now has 1301 Rushing Yards and 12 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 17: LB Mack Arianlacher (AUS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>LB Mack Arianlacher of the Austin Copperheads has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

They greatly outscore them here. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />For this game, my best guess is that Heinrich Kackpoo - LB needs to show up, but if he does the Hahalua defense is very stingy. I expect some incredible plays in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />Their defense will step up this game. They are 1st in sacks with 46. They are 2nd in points allowed, averaging only 20.6. They are 4th in forced fumbles. This may be where we see their true colors. <br /></h3><h2>Who is the better SS? Butchers' Hamish MacAndrew weighs in</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>SS Hamish MacAndrew had words of praise for himself in a recent interview. 'I am one of the best SSs in the game', he said. 'haha, and then these clowns on the internet think Eugene Smoothie is even comparable to me. You pick and drill, and I would gladly show how wrong they are' said the Butchers SS. He added: 'Sure, I do not want to be mean, Eugene Smoothie is a decent SS, but seriously just look at the tape'.</h3><h2>Week 16: QB Monterey Jack (SJS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>The league announced San Jose SaberCats quarterback Monterey Jack has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The SaberCats defeated the Orange County Otters, 40 to 17. Jack did his part, throwing 4 touchdowns, completing 30 of 37 passes for 335 yards. His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 26 to 13, and a passer rating of 96.1.</h3><h2>Week 16: FS Mason Blaylock (NOLA) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>FS Blaylock's ball hawking ability was on display in the Hahalua 31-20 game with the New Orleans Second Line.

He is a great offensive mind. He is innovative with his defense. This will be a very up and down affair. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />For this game, it seems to me that Fred Jones - C needs to show up, but if he does the Hahalua will be putting up points. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />For this game, it seems clear that Ray-Ray Jackson - CB will be a key player to watch. Not only is he a beast on the Hahalua defense, he is a walking highlight reel. Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />The Hahalua are the real deal. <br /></h3><h2>Spais unhappy after Second Line close loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>Blain K. Spais was angry in his postgame interview after the Second Line' loss. The Second Line C said he lost all respect for the Second Line. 'I think this game proves that sometimes teams get lucky in this league, and that the Second Line just got lucky', he said.</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Raphtalia Chan (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Week 15's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Raphtalia Chan.

This game will be so very entertaining. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />I find it hard to bet against coach Joseph Alfaro. He always has them well prepared. Offensively he is a great and innovative thinker. Defensively he makes great adjustments. A single digit win. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />Looking at how the teams match up, I agree with popular opinion that Flash Panda - WR is hard to gameplan for. Look for him to dominate. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />I think having a team players like Medicinal Toblerone (R) - DE is the kind of thing that will help the Second Line win this game. This will really be a statement win. <br /></h3><h2>Mike Karpaasi takes aim at the Sailfish.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Mike Karpaasi pointed fingers when asked about the loss to Sailfish. 'I think we were the best team on the field.

They will continue that streak. They will win this game. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />The leadership on the Hahalua is great. You look at guys like Davriel Lavigne (R) - FS and what he does for a team. Leadership like that helps you win games. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />You just have to look at their offense. They are 1st in the league pass completion percentage. This will be a great game to watch. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Honolulu Hahalua</b><br />In this game, everyone knows that Ray-Ray Jackson - CB has to potential to carry the Hahalua defense. <br /></h3><h2>Mike Karpaasi blasts the Sailfish in aftermath of Sailfish loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Mike Karpaasi pointed fingers when asked about the loss to Sailfish. 'Surely, we have to take responsibility, but they were playing dirty, and it is a testament to their character' said the Sailfish Mike Karpaasi - DE. He continued: 'The Sailfish' players will likely take offense to this, but I do not care. It is what it is, they did not deserve to win'.'</h3><h2>Week 13: RB Darrel Williams (COL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>Week 13's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Darrel Williams.

He is getting paid a lot of money to carry games. Get your popcorn ready. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Austin Copperheads</b><br />We are doing a sweepstakes at the network, and I look forward to raking in the winnings for this bet. Easy prediction. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />This is a very good offense. They are 3rd in the league average yards per rush.

That is how sure I am. <br /></h3><h2>Dissatisfaction after Yeti-Outlaws game!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Heath Evans was angry in his postgame interview after the Outlaws' loss.

The referees will have their work cut out for them. This will be very competitive and intense. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />Do not believe it if anyone tells you the SaberCats are overhyped. They are who we thought they were. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />This defense is likely to step up this week. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : San Jose SaberCats</b><br />They will get another win this week. <br /></h3><h2>Week 1: RB Raphtalia Chan (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>The honor comes after Chan's 24 att, 101 yds, 3 TD, 6 rec, 63 yds, 0 TD performance against the New Orleans Second Line.
