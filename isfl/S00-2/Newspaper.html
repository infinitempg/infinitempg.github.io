They will put up a lot of points. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Berlin Fire Salamanders</b><br />The Fire Salamanders really gell on the field. They play as a unit and that gets them the win this week. You only need to look at guys like Asher Quinn - CB and Benoit Blanco - SS to see the importance. Team players like that helps you win games. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Berlin Fire Salamanders</b><br />In the context of this game, my prediction is that Taylor Cooper (R) will be a key factor from the WR position. He will have a great day and be critical in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Berlin Fire Salamanders</b><br />They won their last game, they will win this game. <br /></h3><h2>Yellowknife Wraiths defense dominates!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>The Wraiths' defense is playing lights out this season. In 15 games they’ve allowed only 4674 total yards and 301 points. Douglas Quaid - LB is the ringleader of the defense with 116 stops on the year. Could the D be back in Yellowknife?</h3><h2>Avon Blocksdale Jr. calls out Liberty DE Zbornak after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>Avon Blocksdale Jr. was angry with his teammates after the loss. He said that the entire team needed to step up. However, he also singled out some teammates. 'We lost and somebody is to blame. If you look at the game, you will see some players just are not delivering.' said the Liberty TE. Asked to clarify, Blocksdale Jr. suggested Dorothy Zbornak - DE needs to perform better, but underscored that there was plenty of blame to go around. 'Guys need to listen, we need to get grinding, you cannot just show up and expect to play or expect to win', Blocksdale Jr. concluded.</h3><h2>Week 17: QB Colby Jack (YKW) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/2.png'>The Yellowknife Wraiths' Colby Jack threw 4 touchdowns, completing 32 of 40 passes for 411 yards in the Wraiths victory over the San Jose SaberCats.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 4 for Jack, has seen some impressive numbers including 24 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Matt Hole consoles Hawks after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>Matt Hole pointed no fingers and saw the upside to the Hawks loss.

A single digit win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Colorado Yeti</b><br />I just really like the way they coach in Colorado. Head coach Donald Reinhardt is doing great things. He is doing some clever things with his defense. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />For this game, you would be a fool not to see that Julio Jones - T has to potential to carry the Outlaws offense. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Arizona Outlaws</b><br />Look for them to continue their winstreak. <br /></h3><h2>Week 16: LB Quenton Bode (C) (NOLA) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>LB Quenton Bode (C) of the New Orleans Second Line has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

If you look at their roster, I see Asher Quinn - CB and Benoit Blanco - SS playing this kind of role. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Austin Copperheads</b><br />Head coach Herb Mast does a great job getting them prepared every week. This week will be no different. He makes great offensive adjustments. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />They will increase their winstreak to two this week. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Berlin Fire Salamanders</b><br />I think having a leader like Susan Cash Jr. (C) - WR is the kind of thing that will help the Fire Salamanders win this game. <br /></h3><h2>Butchers victory feels good to Oberwald.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>Griff Oberwald was pretty blunt in his postgame interview after the Butchers's win. Griff Oberwald - WR known for brutal honesty, said after Chicago beat New York that the Silverbacks's did not seem prepared at all, and that he was frankly embarrased on their behalf.

It will be interesting to see if anyone lashes back, or if calmer heads prevail.</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Darrel Williams (COL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>Week 15's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Darrel Williams.

They are 3rd in run defense. Giving up only 84.3 yards per game. They are 1st in the league pass average yards per rush. They are 4th in forced fumbles. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />I see them winning again this week. The referees will have their work cut out for them. This will be very competitive and intense. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />Leadership. You cannot discount the difference it makes. I am thinking of a guy like Medicinal Toblerone (R) - DE. He will lead the way and help them win. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />I love what they are doing in New Orleans coaching-wise. Head coach Joseph Alfaro is a major reason they will win this game. He is has a really good understanding of what works offensively. He is running an explosive defense. This will be an action-packed affair. <br /></h3><h2>Oberwald delighted after Butchers victory.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>No mincing of words from Griff Oberwald after the Butchers beat the Silverbacks.

This week will be no different. He is has a really good understanding of what works offensively. He is has a really good understanding of what works on defense. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />Looking at the teams, I have no doubt that they will not be able to keep David Rector - CB down for an entire game. Eventually he will come out of the blue and make a big play. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />They will keep their winstreak going. Replace the batteries in your remote.

'We seem to always come up short in the critical situations. I feel like the players are giving their all, but that our coaches just are not holding up their end of the bargain.

I think he will do so this week as well. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Colorado Yeti</b><br />Their defense will step up this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Chicago Butchers</b><br />This week, the Butchers will count on the leadership of Perry Tucker Jr. - T and Hamish MacAndrew - SS to get the win. It is leadership skills like that you need for these tough games. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Colorado Yeti</b><br />Having team player who help coordinate everyone else is invaluable and definitely helps the Yeti win this game. If you look at their roster, I see Earl Sauce - TE and Rotticus Scott - DT playing this kind of role. <br /></h3><h2>Fight breaks out at the Otters' facility.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Reports out of Orange County suggest that Draftee Z - P continues to get attention for all the wrong reasons. There has been numerous under the radar conflicts during training. Often resulting in shouting matches. It all escalated earlier this week when Draftee Z - P threw a punch at William Stephens - T who immediately reciprocated. The Otters is said to be monitoring the situation closely.'.</h3><h2>Week 2: RB Nicholas Ayers (HON) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>The honor comes after Ayers's 23 att, 197 yds, 2 TD performance against the Berlin Fire Salamanders.

You look at a player like Medicinal Toblerone (R) - DE and what he does for a team. He makes everyone around him better. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />The better team wins. The Wraiths are the better team. No argument. This will either be wildly entertaining or a dull grind. I see no middle between the two. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />For this match up, my perspective is that Forrest Gump (C) - RB is the kind of player you just cannot contain for a whole game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : New Orleans Second Line</b><br />Look for them to build on their last win. <br /></h3><h2>J'Vathon (R) targets coach Brandon Norwood after Sailfish loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Tre'Darius J'Vathon (R) seemed almost depressed in an interview after the Sailfish lost to the Brandon Norwood. He indicated that a big factor in the loss was the Sailfish' coaching, that appeared one step behind at every turn. The Sailfish WR said he felt they were outcoached in their latest game. 'We seem to always come up short in the critical situations. I feel like the players are giving their all, but that our coaches just are not holding up their end of the bargain. Especially Head Coach Brandon Norwood has been a dissapointment, he is just not rising to the moment.', he said.</h3><h2>Week 1: QB Suleiman Ramza (R) (OCO) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>The Orange County Otters' Suleiman Ramza (R) threw 4 touchdowns, completing 21 of 29 passes for 327 yards in the Yeti victory over the Orange County Otters.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 0 of the 0 amateur draft, season number 4 for Ramza (R), has seen some impressive numbers including 4 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 1: DE Immanuel Blackstone (C) (COL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>DE Immanuel Blackstone (C) of the Colorado Yeti has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.
