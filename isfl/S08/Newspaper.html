He is doing great things in Yellowknife. He is one of the best defensive minds. It may even be a blow out. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, it is likely that Tex Wrecks (R) - DE is the guy to watch. His paycheck alone should give that away. He will be great to watch. I am really on the fence for this one, but I stand my prediction. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />The difference in this game will be their offense. They are 5th in the league in sacks allowed. They are 5th in the league average yards per rush. They are 3rd in the league rushing touchdowns with 17. They are 1st in the league rushing yards per game. They average 127.2! <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Philadelphia Liberty</b><br />This is just what my gut tells me. I am looking forward to watching this showdown. <br /></h3><h2>Who is the better RB? SaberCats' Rando Cardrissian weighs in</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>When talking to reporters, at a galla event, RB Rando Cardrissian made clear that he does not think Zoe Watts (R) is 'all that'. The SaberCats RB said: 'Is he good? sure. Am I better? No question. I would wipe the floor with him any day'. 'haha, and then these clowns on the internet think Zoe Watts (R) is even comparable to me. You pick and drill, and I would gladly show how wrong they are' said the SaberCats RB. He added: 'Sure, I do not want to be mean, Zoe Watts (R) is a decent RB, but seriously just look at the tape'.</h3><h2>Week 17: QB Dexter Banks II (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>The league announced Sarasota Sailfish quarterback Dexter Banks II has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Sailfish defeated the Orange County Otters, 45 to 30. Banks II did his part, throwing 5 touchdowns, completing 26 of 30 passes for 393 yards. His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 30 to 15, and a passer rating of 96.9.</h3><h2>Week 17: SS Benoit Blanco (BER) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>SS Blanco's ball hawking ability was on display in the Fire Salamanders 37-12 game with the Chicago Butchers. He finished with 6 Tck, 1 Int, 1 Def TD, 1 FF.<br /><br />    "Benoit has the unique ability to make plays and generate turnovers." -Fire Salamanders Defensive Coordinator</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 17</h2><h3>Yeti - 37, Outlaws - 30<br />      Wraiths - 36, SaberCats - 14<br />      Copperheads - 17, Hahalua - 14<br />      Fire Salamanders - 37, Butchers - 12<br />      Second Line - 31, Hawks - 24<br />      Liberty - 20, Silverbacks - 17<br />      Sailfish - 45, Otters - 30</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Yellowknife Wraiths at San Jose SaberCats</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />This will be a very entertaining game. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, I predict that Maurice Virtanen - T drives defenses crazy. I see a lot of points being scored in this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />Look for their offense to dominate. They are 2nd in the league pass completion percentage. They are 1st in the league passing yards per game. They average 298.8! They are 1st in the league in sacks allowed. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />Head coach Darryl Gunderson puts them over the top in this game. He is one of the best defensive minds. This game will be so very entertaining. <br /></h3><h2>Philadelphia Liberty Catch the Colorado Yeti by surprise!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>With an outstanding performance the Philadelphia Liberty pull off the upset against Colorado Yeti.<br />Everyone had expected the Colorado Yeti to get an easy win at home against the Philadelphia Liberty. The Liberty however, thought differently. Blowing a must win game will surely put a dent in the Yeti confidence.</h3><h2>Mike Hockhertz lashes out at coach after loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>Mike Hockhertz was angry about the game against Silas Damon. Moreover, he denied that the players were at fault. The Butchers LB said he felt they were outcoached in their latest game. 'We seem to always come up short in the critical situations. I feel like the players are giving their all, but that our coaches just are not holding up their end of the bargain. Especially Defensive Coordinator Silas Damon has been a dissapointment, he is just not rising to the moment.', he said.</h3><h2>Week 16: RB Raphtalia Chan (SAR) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Week 16's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Raphtalia Chan. His 24 att, 116 yds, 2 TD, 1 rec, 53 yds, 1 TD performance stood out in the 45 to 24 victory for the Sarasota Sailfish.<br /><br />    The former UCF gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 1542 Yards and 11 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 16: LB Jack Banks (NYS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/14.png'>LB Jack Banks of the New York Silverbacks has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

They are 5th in sacks with 32. They are 3rd in run defense. Giving up only 82.1 yards per game. They are 1st in interceptions with 15. It might be a high scoring game. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />In the context of this game, I think a good bet is that Nero Alexander (C) - DE will be a key figure in this game. The Wraiths defense relies on him. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />Their offense will step up this game. They are 2nd in the league pass completion percentage. They are 4th in the league passing touchdowns with 27. They are 2nd in the league passing yards per game. They average 294.3! They are 1st in the league in sacks allowed. Believe me. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Yellowknife Wraiths</b><br />I just really like the way they coach in Yellowknife. Head coach Darryl Gunderson is doing great things. He is one of the best defensive minds. <br /></h3><h2>Philadelphia Liberty surprise everyone!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>The Philadelphia Liberty have managed an unlikely win against New Orleans Second Line.<br />The Second Line appeared dejected towards the end of the game, while the Liberty kept their cool and drove the victory home. Most pundits had expected the Second Line to win with ease, and the loss to such an inferior opponent is a tough blow to the lofty expectations for the program. Meanwhile, the Liberty fans were celebrating in the street, having had their hopes for the future bolstered at least momentarily.</h3><h2>Hayes sour after Liberty loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/7.png'>War of words the between the Liberty and the Liberty after game. 'Surely, we have to take responsibility, but they were playing dirty, and it is a testament to their character' said the Liberty Rutherford B. Hayes - G. He continued: 'The Liberty' players will likely take offense to this, but I do not care. It is what it is, they did not deserve to win'.'</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Gunner Thorbjornsson (R) (ARI) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/4.png'>Week 15's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Gunner Thorbjornsson (R).

Not only is he a beast on the Yeti defense, he is a walking highlight reel. I am looking forward to watching this showdown. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Colorado Yeti</b><br />This week, the Yeti will will need to come together as a team to win. Players like Earl Sauce - TE and Rotticus Scott - DT who have great team playing skills and understand what everyone needs to to will be pivotal for this. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Colorado Yeti</b><br />In this game, popular opinion is that Richard Gilbert - RB needs to show up, but if he does the Yeti will be putting up points. Believe me. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Colorado Yeti</b><br />I do not think you get very far against their offense. They are 5th in the league passing touchdowns with 25. They are 2nd in the league in sacks allowed. They are maulers, 5th in the league in pancakes. They are 1st in the league average yards per rush. They are 3rd in the league rushing yards per game.

Blowing a must win game will surely put a dent in the Outlaws confidence.</h3><h2>Nelson still having red flags</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>The commisioner, in a recent interview, hinted that new investigations were under way concerning Otters' DE David Nelson David Nelson has tried to stay clear of trouble, and has publicly professed a desire to better himself. Yet, flags keep popping up, and one has to think the Otters are worried about the recent developments.</h3><h2>Week 14: RB Darrel Williams (COL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>Week 14's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Darrel Williams. His 18 att, 202 yds, 2 TD performance stood out in the 54 to 24 victory for the Colorado Yeti.<br /><br />    The former LSU gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 1430 Yards and 10 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Hunter Harrison taunts the Wraiths after Otters victory.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Hunter Harrison came out swinging in an interview after the Otters beat the Wraiths. Hunter Harrison - T known for brutal honesty, said after Orange County beat Yellowknife that the Wraiths's did not seem prepared at all, and that he was frankly embarrased on their behalf. Them be fighting words to many a Wraiths fan, let alone the players. It will be interesting to see if anyone lashes back, or if calmer heads prevail.</h3><h2>Week 14: LB Tyron Brackenridge (C) (SJS) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>LB Brackenridge (C) absolutely dominated in the SaberCats 32-12 game with the Berlin Fire Salamanders.

This will either be wildly entertaining or a dull grind. I see no middle between the two. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />With people like Doug Howlett (R) - WR and Nacho Fries - G who understand the value of team play it is easy to see why the Hawks win this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Colorado Yeti</b><br />In this game, we have to acknowledge that Mo Magic - T will dominate the defense. This is going to be great to watch. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Baltimore Hawks</b><br />Their defense will step up this game. They are 4th in points allowed, averaging only 23.3.

Luke Skywalker (C) - QB known for brutal honesty, said after Honolulu beat Berlin that the Fire Salamanders's did not seem prepared at all, and that he was frankly embarrased on their behalf. Them be fighting words to many a Fire Salamanders fan, let alone the players. It will be interesting to see if anyone lashes back, or if calmer heads prevail.</h3><h2>Week 3: CB Louisiana Purchase (COL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>CB Louisiana Purchase of the Colorado Yeti has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Purchase finished with 7 Tck, 2 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 3</h2><h3>Wraiths - 27, SaberCats - 19<br />      Outlaws - 33, Otters - 17<br />      Copperheads - 23, Second Line - 16<br />      Hahalua - 36, Silverbacks - 33<br />      Butchers - 30, Yeti - 20</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Colorado Yeti at Chicago Butchers</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Colorado Yeti</b><br />Do not believe it if anyone tells you the Yeti are overhyped. They are who we thought they were. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Colorado Yeti</b><br />This will be a tough game and that is where leaders such as William Lim - WR and Leeroy Jenkins - WR will shine and help them get the win. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Colorado Yeti</b><br />Looking at the teams, I think that Greedy Sly is the best CB that will see the field. He will have a great day and be critical in this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Colorado Yeti</b><br />Looking at the two rosters, I suspect that the Yeti' offense goes through Darrel Williams - RB. When he is at his best, the Yeti offense is like a well oiled machine. <br /></h3><h2>Week 2: RB Jamar Lackson (SJS) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/6.png'>The honor comes after Lackson's 16 att, 187 yds, 4 TD performance against the Baltimore Hawks.

IHeart Syracuse - FS known for brutal honesty, said after Baltimore beat Yellowknife that the Wraiths's did not seem prepared at all, and that he was frankly embarrased on their behalf. Them be fighting words to many a Wraiths fan, let alone the players. It will be interesting to see if anyone lashes back, or if calmer heads prevail.</h3><h2>Week 2: LB Juan Domine (R) (CHI) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/9.png'>LB Domine (R) absolutely dominated in the Butchers 27-14 game with the Austin Copperheads.

He is getting paid a lot. The reason he is getting paid a lot is that he is really good. Do I need to say more?And you can take that with you to the bank. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Austin Copperheads</b><br />They will get another win this week. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Chicago Butchers</b><br />This is a very good offense. There will be a lot to dissect after this game. <br /></h3><h2>Week 1: RB Darrel Williams (COL) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>Week 1's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Darrel Williams.

Sailfish blames coaching.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>Xavien Adams seemed almost depressed in an interview after the Sailfish lost to the Benjamin Waddell. He indicated that a big factor in the loss was the Sailfish' coaching, that appeared one step behind at every turn. Xavien Adams - CB was clearly upset in the Sailfish loss. 'We learned a lot. We learned a lot about our coaches. We realized that there is a reason we are losing. I am not sure what Benjamin Waddell saw in his preparation, but he has to do a better job at Defensive Coordinator', the CB said.</h3><h2>Week 1: FS Mason Blaylock (NOLA) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>FS Blaylock's ball hawking ability was on display in the Second Line 20-12 game with the Sarasota Sailfish.

You heard it here first. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Warren Swamp Bats</b><br />Replace the batteries in your remote. You do not want to miss this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Charleston Jazz</b><br />For this game, it should be clear that Rickie Vaughne (R) - CB needs to show up, but if he does the Jazz will be shutting people down. <br /></h3><h2>G William Bills (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>G William Bills (47 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>CB Simon Dominguez (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>CB Simon Dominguez (50 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>CB Bertram Harms (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>CB Bertram Harms (35 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>Post Free Agency Retirements</h2><h3>The following players have retired after going unsigned through free agency:</h3><h2>DT Donald Hopper (N/A) has retired!</h2><h3>DT Donald Hopper (40 ovr) has retired after failing to get signed in free agency.</h3><h2>Free Agency Round 10:  Round Up</h2><h3>42 players signed this week.<br /><br />The biggest name signing this week was Phillip Forrest.
